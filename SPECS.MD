Using a RFM95, RA-01. or RA-02 LoRA 900Mhz Radio

The basics is to broadcast a message out of the status display or some message. For HatChan I plan on broadcasting latest posts, GPS Coords, GPS Time, 

For things like the guy who does the Wifi APs, you can publish a list of APs currently.

I'm working on the protocol now once I get my radios in (7/16/2019)
